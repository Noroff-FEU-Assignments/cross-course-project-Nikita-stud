    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would advise them to find a suitable host that is on the more expensive side, one that provides support and security like no other. 
      Depending on what website our client has, we can begin to look into double authentication of some sort. 
      It could be a code send as an email or SMS additional to the password.
      Get yourself SSL certified to have yours and your clients data encrypted.
