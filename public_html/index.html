    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>

    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words
    </p>

    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would advise them to find a suitable host that is on the more expensive side, one that provides support and security like no other. 
      It is known to be as much of a problem getting compromised on their side as it is on yours, constant available support and up to date server with good protection is a must.
      Depending on what website our client has, we can begin to look into double authentication of some sort. 
      This could be a code send as an email or SMS additional to the password. This process will give you an additional protection, even if your password is compromised. 
      Get yourself SSL certified to have yours and your clients data encrypted. 
      Have your team update the website more often than not, so you have an additional check for the compromise of the code. (sanitizing)
      Have the user restart the page or write his private information again after a certain amount of time of not completing the process of checking out.
      Dont forget to have your code written and vulnerability checked, through CI/CD. or one of the security checks online. 
      Such practice will make any errors/threats more visible to you, so you can do something about them in the near future. 
      Try breaking into your website yourself or hire someone to try and hack it themselves, this can also lead to great improvements that no one though of.
